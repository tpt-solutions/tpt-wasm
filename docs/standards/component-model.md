# Component Model

**Status:** Planned (M10)  
**Specification:** https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/  

The Component Model is a higher-level layer over Core WebAssembly.

```
Component
   │
   ├── Core Wasm module(s)
   │
   ▼
Component runtime
   │
   ▼
TPT Host
```

The Micro Interpreter must not be polluted with Component Model concepts.
Core Wasm is the foundation; the Component Model builds on top.

## Integration path

```
Core Module → Component → WIT Interface → TPT Capability
```

The Component Model emphasizes capability-safe interfaces and fine-grained sandboxing,
making it a natural fit for the TPT Host architecture.

## Design constraint

The TPT Host ABI must not be designed in a way that makes future Component Model
integration impossible. This informs the capability and resource model design.
